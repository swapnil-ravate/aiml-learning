# AI/ML Learning Journey

A collection of my daily Python-based Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning practice.  
This repository includes hands-on exercises, notebooks, mini-projects, and notes as I explore AI/ML concepts step by step.

## What's Inside
- Python basics for AI/ML  
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib  
- Data preprocessing & visualization  
- Machine Learning algorithms  
- Mini projects & experiments  


## Goal
Build a solid foundation in Python, AI, and Machine Learning while creating a strong portfolio for future opportunities.
